Duplicati is an Open Source project, originally written and maintained by Kenneth Skovhede. We would like to thank all contributors and maintainers of third party modules who made Duplicati what it is today. A special thanks to the many users who let us know how they are using Duplicati, ask for new features, test development builds and thus help us improve Duplicati further.
