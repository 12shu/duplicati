The gdata version found here is built from Google GData 2.2.0.0:
https://google-gdata.googlecode.com/files/libgoogle-data-mono-2.2.0.0.tar.gz

The download does not contain pre-built binaries, and it is missing the NewtonSoft.Json.dll.

The build was performed with NewtonSoft.Json.dll 4.5.0.0.

If you upgrade, be aware that Duplicati itself also uses NewtonSoft.Json.dll so you
should upgrade both at the same time.
